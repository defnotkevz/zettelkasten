set a big 6 month goal
start a business - full control over the product, audience, revenue
choosing a business model that allows you to achieve that goal without sacrificing your interests

	you need an audience and a way to monetize that audience

you need attention. 

how can 'I' become a business? what is my unique value proposition?

make leverage

focusing on social media.


minimalism -> making room for what actually makes progess, that 20%. It's about focusing on the few tasks that bring outsized results and systemizing, outsourcing, or delegating the rest.

the 4 hour workday philosophy.
- if you're working more than 4 hours a day, then you need to systemize, automate or delegate.


being lost
being curious
being intense
being consistent


what is active rest?

have time for "shower thoughts". don't always be in doing mode.


work on a project of your own.

why doesn't some work feel like work?


the reason every day feels like a challenge is that you are learning/doing something new.


vision > 10 year goal > 1 year goal > monthly goals > weekly goals > daily goals


when you consume too much and create too little, you get anxious. when you create too much and consume too little, you get bored. 

fill your mind in the afternoon with books, podcasts and content.
do the actual work in the morning
empty your mind and reflect upon it in the night

consume, connect, create.
