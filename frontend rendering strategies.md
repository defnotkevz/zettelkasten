rendering - turning code into content that users see and interact.

Imagine rendering strategies like different ways to serve a meal:
- Pre-cook everything (static rendering)
- Refire cold plates (incremental static revalidation)
- Cook dishes as orders come in (server-side rendering)
- Give customers ingredients to prepare themselves (client-side rendering)

Each approach has its place. The best restaurants use a *combination* of approaches.
