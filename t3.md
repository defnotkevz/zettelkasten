we use either useQuery or useMutation in the frontend (the client) .
and we have a **procedure** in the backend.

trpc.api.*route.procedure*

trpc sits in front of next js and is not a backend of its own

the createNextApHandler helps use trpc with next js and there are other functions that help us use trpc with express


context. (createTRPCContext)
- this is anything we want to have in all our procedures.
- like your session and db connection.

middleware. wraps around the procedure
- middleware is like onion. the last one to run just at input before the procedure is the first one to run at output
- you can create middlewares and put it with procedures. 
- the protected procedure is just a public procedure with a auth middleware.
