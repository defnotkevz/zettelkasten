so first, i'll introduce myself ...

we are relatively a new company, so we are looking for someone not with just development skills. but someone who takes intitiatives, get things done to completion, a person with an eye for design, 

we'll go through your resume, some questions on the tech stack and then a coding question.

what stack are you comfortable with?

I had an interview where I was asked what my skill level was for a specific language/framework/etc on a scale of 1-10.

I answered with a 7.

The interviewer then asked, "Why do you say you're a 7 and what question would you ask someone with a 7 skill level in _insert language/framework/etc_ to prove they are really a 7?"
