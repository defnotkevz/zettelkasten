building typesafe APIs with tRPC

tRPC - Typesafe Remote Procedure Calls

API Routes - do we use interfaces with API Routes?

trpc allows us to build fully typesafe APIs without any schema or code generation.


prisma and Supabase

we will use prisma to seed the database
supabase is run as a container -> might be for a local db


next js has api folder -> auth routes and trpc routes
also has server folder - server side rendering?


nextjs config typescript and esbuild ignorebuilderrors: true
