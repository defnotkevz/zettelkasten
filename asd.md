set a big 6 month goal
start a business - full control over the product, audience, revenue
choosing a business model that allows you to achieve that goal without sacrificing your interests

	you need an audience and a way to monetize that audience

you need attention. 

how can 'I' become a business? what is my unique value proposition?


focusing on social media.


minimalism -> making room for what actually makes progess, that 20%. It's about focusing on the few tasks that bring outsized results and systemizing, outsourcing, or delegating the rest.

the 4 hour workday philosophy.
- if you're working more than 4 hours a day, then you need to systemize, automate or delegate.
