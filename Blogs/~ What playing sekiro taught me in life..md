- I recently saw a video titled 'How you play games is how you do everything in life'.
- How you do anything in life is how you do everything in life.
- Sekiro - open world game, just like human life, at a point of time you are faced with multiple challenges.
- If you win the game(and in life), you gain honour and nothing else. 
- Was playing as a samurai instead as a shinobi.
- The fact that you reached the boss, doesn't mean you are deserving a fight with the boss or you have a chance at defeating the boss. 
- Maybe you reached doing the bare minimum. And when you reach the boss you understand how highly unprepared you are.
- I never learned mikiri counter or learnt how to deflect which were the bread and butter of combat.
- Go back, grind, get the basics correct.
