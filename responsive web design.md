When `em` is used for font sizes, it is relative to the font size of the parent element.
When `em` is used for padding or margin, it is relative to the font size of the element itself. 

so if i use rems for padding or margin, it won't scale according to the content in the element

so for using `em` on paddings and margin the buttons kinda scale up. if `rem` then the space around is the same on all buttons. (visualise it)


fontsizes -> px at the Root, rem for Components, em for Text Elements
