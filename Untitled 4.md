we have workspaces?


we have an app, that is supposed to be an all in one creator tool for content creators and marketers alike. we have content creation along with content repurposing and some basic ai features like chat. we are mainly looking at 3 main parts of the app. one is where we have textual data as input. so that will be the document writer. in that document, we can create content like blog posts, youtube video script, instagram posts etc. and the second part is where we give audio as input. so audio files can be uploaded and they will be transcribed and from those transcriptions, we will be able to create content. so this is more like content repurposing right?  and the third part is where we give videos as the input. and here, our future plans is to have some kind of video generation and clipping and creating b rolls type stuff but right now the features are not finalised. so with this in mind. How will the UX and the user flow of the app look like? how can the features of the app segregated in the main page and what would the dashboard contain and how would the
