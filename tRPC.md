tRPC - Typesafe Remote Procedure Calls
tRPC is a way to build APIs like REST or GraphQL

tRPC gives typesafety when building APIs. So the frontend and backend is tightly coupled. It also has a request batching feature, while making mutiple requests.

Essentially we are using TypeScript to link the backend and the frontend. So we have typesafe communication between them.

tRPC is set upt with routes and procedures.
routes are the folder names and procedures are the filenames.

```
tRPC uses React Query under the hood?
